pd-grainders (granular synthesis in Pd)
=======================================

This repository contains a few patches to perform granular synthesis. From sample-based granulation to live-input to synthesised sound. All or some of these patches need the following externals: *cyclone ggee hcs iemlib mapping maxlib motex purepd zexy*

List of Contents:

0.probability-graphs. A couple of patches illustrating tendency masks and various probability distributions.

1.sine-grainder. Granular synthesis with sine waves.

2.pulse-grainder. Granular synthesis with unit-pulses and karplus-strong resonances.

3.file-grainder. Takes a mono soundfile (.wav) and performs granular synthesis on it.

4.input-grainder. Stores incoming audio to a delay line and performs basic granular synthesis operations.

5.VoSim. Simple implementation of the VoSim (Voice Simulation) synchronous granular technique.
